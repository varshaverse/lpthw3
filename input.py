# How Input works

print("How old are you?", end=' ') # pc asks how old are you, input is whatever from the keyboard
age = int(input()) # keyboard data is saved in variable in age
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = (input())
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = int(input()) # we mention int so we can only get values that are integers not anything else


print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.") #prints out all your data

age = input("How old are you?")
print(f"Your age is {age} years old. ")
